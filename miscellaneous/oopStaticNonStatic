The difference between static and non-static is that the first one doesn't need instantiation so you can call the classname then append :: to it and call the method immediately. Like so:

    ClassName::method();

and if the method is not static you need to initialize it like so:

    $var = new ClassName();
    $var->method();

However, in PHP 5.4 you can use this syntax instead as a shorthand:

    (new ClassName)->method();
